This was my final project to achieve the bachelor degree in the Federal University of Cear√°.
It consists in a web tool that supports the use of a methodology called PBL (problem based learning) by professors and students;

Describing in simple words, it is a repository for software projects that allow users to manage not only the projects in the tool but the application of problems in different classes with different objective.
It also provide features to manage access to its content and a module to facilitate the prioritization and discussion of requirements available in the tool.

the tool was built using Java, VRaptor Framework, JSPs, HTML, CSS and JavaScript;
